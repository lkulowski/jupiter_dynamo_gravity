Zonal (east-west) flows occur throughout Jupiter's interior. Near the "surface" of the planet, we observe alternating east-west jets with peak speeds of ~100 m/s. The surface winds may extend thousands of kilometers deep into the planet, or be confined to a thin weather layer on top of weaker convective flows. Deeper down, in the dynamo region where the magnetic field is generated, there are slow zonal flows with speeds on the order of 0.1-20 cm/s. The zonal flows within the deep atmosphere and dynamo region are associated with high and low pressures, and thus with density perturbations relative to the mean background density. The density perturbations induced by zonal flows alter Jupiter's gravity field.

Zonal flows in the upper 3000 km of Jupiter's non-conducting atmosphere with amplitudes greater than a few meters per second can produce gravity signals that are consistent with the recent Juno gravity observations. The gravity contribution from flows deeper down in the dynamo region, however, have not yet been investigated.  

Zonal flow in the dynamo region could have a non-negligible contribution to Jupiter's gravity field. Although the dynamo zonal flow is expected to be only on the order of 0.1-20 cm/s the flow occupies most of the volume of the planet and resides in a region with a large background density. The slow motion of a large volume of dense fluid has the potential to produce a large gravity signal. 

In this project, we calculate the gravity signal produced physically motivated dynamo zonal flow profiles. We begin by constructing zonal flow profiles for the dynamo region in [Section 2](#2-determining-the-zonal-flow-in-the-dynamo-region). We then develop the mathematical framework to calculate the density perturbation and gravity signal associated with the zonal flow in [Section 3](#3-gravity-calculation). Then, we calculate the gravity signal for a few example flows in [Section 4](#4-Results).  


## 2 Determining the zonal flow in the dynamo region 

The first step in this project is to determine the zonal flow in the dynamo region. We simplify the dyamics so that 

## 3 Gravity calculation

There are two steps to calculate the gravity signal produced by a zonal flow profile. First, we calculate the density perturbation associated with the zonal flow using the vorticity equation. Then, we integrate the density perturbation over the volume of the planet to obtain the zonal gravity harmonics. 

The detailed derivation is given in Kulowski et al. (2018) (<em> submitted </em>).
