Zonal (east-west) flows occur throughout Jupiter's interior. Near the "surface" of the planet, we observe alternating east-west jets with peak speeds of ~100 m/s. The surface winds may extend thousands of kilometers deep into the planet, or be confined to a thin weather layer on top of weaker convective flows. Deeper down, in the dynamo region where the magnetic field is generated, there are slow zonal flows with speeds on the order of 0.1-20 cm/s. The zonal flows within the deep atmosphere and dynamo region are associated with high and low pressures, and thus with density perturbations relative to the mean background density. The density perturbations induced by zonal flows alter Jupiter's gravity field.
